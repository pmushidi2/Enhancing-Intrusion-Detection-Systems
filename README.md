This repository implements a proactive equivalence-based filter to enhance intrusion detection systems (IDS) by improving accuracy and reliability, reducing false positives/negatives, and providing robust cybersecurity defenses.

Enhancing Intrusion Detection Systems: A Proactive Equivalence-Based Filter for Upstream Security Risk Mitigation

Overview
Intrusion detection in network environments is a pivotal aspect of cybersecurity that dictates subsequent analysis and countermeasure strategies, significantly enhancing the robustness of security policies. Despite their importance, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face substantial challenges in maintaining efficacy due to the evolving morphological complexity of cyber-attacks. This evolution often results in elevated rates of false positives and false negatives, undermining IDS reliability.

Traditional reactive approaches employing various inference-based techniques have attempted to address these limitations, particularly in high-speed networks. Yet, they fall short of eliminating the persistent security risks to hosts.

In this project, we highlight the inadequacies of these reactive measures and advocate for a novel proactive approach using a filter based on equivalence methods. This proactive filter operates by renaming and performing an in-depth analysis of security policy variables within a system or network segment, thereby preemptively nullifying the potential for successful attacks on a host. By acting as a censorship gateway that enforces rules rather than relying solely on detection via signatures or behavior, this approach effectively circumvents the inherent weaknesses of traditional reactive methods. Our findings suggest that this proactive equivalence-based filtering significantly enhances intrusion detection accuracy and reliability, paving the way for more resilient and robust cybersecurity defenses.
